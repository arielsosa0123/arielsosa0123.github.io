		<h1>Welcome To My Homepage!</h1>
	
		<HR>
		<p>  My name is Ariel Sosa, and I’m a junior transfer student majoring in Computer 
    	Science at the University at Buffalo. Originally from Long Island, NY, I’m passionate 
    	about technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning.</p> 
		<p>
		<p>  I’m currently pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science, with a focus on software engineering, mobile applications, 
    	and system design. Through coursework and hands-on projects, I’ve developed mobile apps 
    	using Java and SQLite, implemented core data structures in C++ and Python, and worked 
    	extensively with remote machines to build and test software in distributed environments.</p> 
		<p>
    	<p>  I enjoy exploring how systems operate and finding elegant solutions to technical challenges.
    	As an active member of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), I engage in 
    	collaborative projects and professional development opportunities that help me grow both 
    	technically and personally. I’m currently seeking software engineering internships where 
    	I can contribute to meaningful projects, learn from experienced mentors, and continue 
    	building my skills.</p>
